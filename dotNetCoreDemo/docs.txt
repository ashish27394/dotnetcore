Configure method in the startup.cs configures the HTTP processing pipeline
for asp.net core apps.
That is, for every HTTP msg that arrives, it is the code inside of this
Configure method that will define the components that respond to that 
request.

BuildWebHost is the method which will build the web server
1)Will use Kestrel web server(cross platform)
2)IIS integration(useful in the intranet apps)
3)Logging which will be seen in output window in the VS
4)IConfigurable service made available
 -JSON file(appsettings.json)
 -User secrets
 -Environment variables
 -Command line arguments

The default file for configuration is appsettings.json
create the file in root directory and you can get configures setting

-environment variable can override the value in the appsettings.json
-value given at comd can override both environment variable and
appsettings.json values

-----------------------------------

-If we are building our own custom services then we need 
to register those services using ConfigureServices method

startup class has two responsibilities 
1)ConfigureServices method 
-Gives you a place to register your own custom services 
so that asp.net core can use those services and pass them 
around not only to itself. if you want to customize how the asp.net  
core framework behaves, but also to other to other areas of app like 
the Configure method
2)Configure method
-For request pipeline

Injecting IConfigurable for getting value from
appsettings instead of passing the constant value
